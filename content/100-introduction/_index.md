**Amazon API Gateway** is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

- APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services.
- Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications.
- API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.
