**Amazon API Gateway** is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

- APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services.
- Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications.
- API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.

**AWS Lambda** is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you, making it easier to build applications that respond quickly to new information.
