Before starting this workshop, you need:

1. An IAM user with `AdministratorAccess` permissions that you can login with to AWS Management Console.

![alt text](/images/workshop-2/IAM-user-login-and-permissions.png)

   If you haven't create an IAM user, follow [Create IAM Group and IAM User :: MANAGING ACCESS CONTROL WITH AWS IAM (IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT)](https://000002.awsstudygroup.com/2-create-admin-user-and-group/) to create one.

2. The CRUD Lambda functions (`create-user`, `list-users`, `get-user`, `update-user`, `delete-user`) that will be used as the backend, which is integrated with the REST API Gateway.

   If you haven't create these CRUD Lambda functions, follow previous workshop to create them.
